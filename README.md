# Biclustering-SSVD
Implementation of the sparse singular value decomposition algorithm (Lee et al., 2010) to be used for Biclustering; Duke STA663 Final Project

The `Sparse SVD First Pass` notebook implements the algorithm from Lee et al., 2010, whose code is publically available in matlab and R (see `ssvd.R`, `ssvd.m`, and `thresh.m`). `Data.txt` is one of the two application examples from the paper (the genes example). The paper, Lee et al., 2010, can be found at `ssvd.pdf`. 

TODO: This code is not optimized and runs quite slowly...must optimize in future versions.
